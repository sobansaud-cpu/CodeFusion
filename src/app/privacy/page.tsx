        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          CodeFusion AI ("we", "us") takes your privacy seriously. This page explains
          what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it â€” including
          how Google may use data when ads are shown.
        </p>

        <h3>Information we collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Account information you provide (email, display name).</li>
          <li>Automatically collected usage data (IP address, device, pages visited).</li>
          <li>Cookies and similar technologies for analytics and advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How we use information</h3>
        <p>
          We use data to provide and improve our service, to personalize content and
          to show relevant ads. We do not sell your personal information. For advertising,
          we use Google AdSense which may collect data for ad personalization.
        </p>

        <h3>Google AdSense and third-party advertising</h3>
        <p>
          We participate in Google AdSense. Google may use cookies and other
          identifiers to serve personalized ads. To opt out of personalized advertising,
          users can visit Ad Settings at Google.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
        <p>
          We use cookies for session management, analytics, and advertising. You can
          control cookie settings through your browser.
        </p>

        <h3>Data retention and security</h3>
        <p>
          We retain data only as long as needed. We take reasonable measures to protect
          your data, but no system is 100% secure.
        </p>
